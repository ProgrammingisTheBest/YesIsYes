Thank you for trying to decide to use Computer Security! 

This is a AV developed by a Programmer Kid, this is made in visual Studio code. Isn't the best but still can detect viruses in your computer.

To active please open the main hub and select the main file, then select the file that you downloaded to see if it has a virus or not.

If it has a virus it will say: "Infected" || If it doesn't have a virus it will say: "Clean"!

Contact the Developer on discord: SCP - 999#3902
